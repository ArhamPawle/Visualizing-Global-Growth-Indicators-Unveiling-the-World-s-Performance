# Visualizing-Global-Growth-Indicators-Unveiling-the-World-s-Performance
"Visualizing Global Growth Indicators" leverages World Bank data with Python to make complex economic and social trends more accessible. Using line graphs, animations, and predictive modeling, it highlights key factors like economics and sustainability, helping stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions for a sustainable future.

Greetings from the project! For data visualization, code and data files are available in this repository. The Plot1.py, Plot2.py, Plot3.py, Plot4.py, and Plot5.py Python scripts are the primary files you should be concerned with. These scripts are made to produce particular plots according to the data that is supplied.
Code and Data: The "Code and Data" zip file contains the required Python scripts and data files. In order to access the project files, please extract the contents of this zip file. You may disregard any extraneous CSV files that may be in the zip file since only the ones that are required are crucial for the project. Plot1.py: Python script for generating Plot 1.
Plot2.py: Python script for generating Plot 2.
Plot3.py: Python script for generating Plot 3.
Plot4.py: Python script for generating Plot 4.
Plot5.py: Python script for generating Plot 5. As your integrated development environment (IDE), Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is advised for the best possible programming experience. Easy folder access and an intuitive UI are features of VS Code. Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed in your environment:
 pandas
 numpy
 matplotlib
 seaborn
 country_converter
You can install these libraries using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn country_converter
Steps
1. Extract the contents of the "Code and Data" zip file.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code for easy access to files.
3. Install the required libraries using the provided command.
4. Run the desired Python script (Plot1.py, Plot2.py, etc.) to generate the corresponding plot.
